What Is This Script
-------------------

This is a [Blender 2.6] (http://www.blender.org) Importer script for the [LDraw System of Tools's Brick Library.] (http://www.ldraw.org) 
> LDraw is a popular system of free software tools for modeling Lego creations in 3D on a computer. The LDraw file format and original program were written by > > James Jessiman. He also modeled many of the original parts in the parts library that is central to the programs and is under continuous maintenance and 
> extension by the LDraw community. In 1997, Jessiman died. Since then, a variety of programs have been written that use the LDraw parts library, and file format.
