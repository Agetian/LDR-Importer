Blender 2.6 LDraw Importer Readme
=================================
Hello everybody! le717 here, reminding you that if you would like to learn more about this project, or donate code to it, you need to read this first.

What Is This Script
-------------------

This is a [Blender 2.6] (http://www.blender.org) Importer script for the [LDraw System of Tools's Brick Library.] (http://www.ldraw.org) 

> LDrawâ„¢ is an open standard for LEGO CAD programs that allow the user to create virtual LEGO models and scenes. You can use it to document models you have
>physically built, create building instructions just like LEGO, render 3D photo realistic images of your virtual models and even make animations. 
>The possibilities are endless. Unlike real LEGO bricks where you are limited by the number of parts and colors, in LDraw nothing is impossible.

There are many LDraw importer scripts for Blender 2.3 available, each one with its own errors and quirks, some that have even been lost over time due to dead links. Many people have wanted an updated version of these scripts for a while, but nobody seemed to want to write one.
